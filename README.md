# roguelike-pygame
## How to play:
Clone the repo and make sure [python](https://www.python.org/) is installed. I used the latest 3.9.7 for this project. Then install [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/):
```
pip install pygame
```
or
```
python3 -m pip install pygame
```
and to play the game, run:
```
python3 main.py
```
